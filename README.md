# Car-Tunes ðŸš—

This project is a Car Management Application where users can create, view, edit, and delete car entries. The application allows users to manage their cars by uploading images, setting a title, adding a description, and tagging the cars with various attributes. It supports user authentication to ensure data privacy, where each user can only access and manage their own car entries.
